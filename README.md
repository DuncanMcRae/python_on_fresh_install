# python_on_fresh_install
How to setup a new Linux install for use with python (also relevant for MacOS and Windows)

_Updated: 2021-09-17_

# THE TLDR;
pyenv -> pipx -> poetry -> python  
also: git  
In general [Best practice for setting up a python env](https://towardsdatascience.com/best-practices-for-setting-up-a-python-environment-d4af439846a)

# PYENV
What is it: pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python as well as create virtual environments. We will only be using if for the python versions and **NOT** the virual envs (poetry will do that).
How to install it:
* [Install dependancies](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment)
* Install it from git clone following [this guide](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
* If Linux using  the terminal zsh, you need to install the echos in to `~/.zprofile` (might not exist) and `~/.bash_profile`
* init the shell with the zsh echo in to the `~./zshrc`
* check to see if the shims are at the start of your path `echo $PATH`

How to use it:
* list available versions of python `pyenv install -l`
* install the version that you want `pyenv install 3.9.7`
* update the shims after install with `pyenv rehash`
* set version as global `pyenv global 3.9.7` or local (that folder) `pyenv local 3.9.7`
* check what versions of python are installed `pyenv versions` and what is running `pyenv --version`

# PIPX
What is it: pipx allows you to install global python tools that will be useable throughout all virtual envs.  Linting tools like _mypy_, _flake8_, formatters like _black_, and dependency management tools like _poetry_ can be installed once globally and reused across projects  
How to install it:
* [pipx git page](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)
* Make sure you have an active global python working `pyenv global` then install with `pip install pipx`
* Add pipx to _PATH_ by running `pipx ensurepath`
* Install tools `pipx black`, `pipx poetry` and the others.
* Check black installed `black --version`
* List all installed python libraries `pipx list`. This also shows where the apps are exposed on the $PATH. Take note for vscode.

# POETRY
What is it: [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) is a python packaging and dependancy management tool that can also create virtual environments. NOTE: `pip` does not check for dependancy issues, so `poetry` is better.  
How to use it:  
* you can build a new project using `poetry new project_name` and this will create a _recommended_ project. You can also initialise an existing project using `poetry init`. Initialisation asks you a host of questions to build the `pyproject.toml` file - creating a new project defaults these values. I have found using `poetry new project_name` is better than initialising a project that is already in progress using `poetry init` as this does not appear to insert _python_ in to the `pyproject.toml` file. I have found poetry will fail on some library importing for unknown reasons as _python_ is not present in the toml file - this happens with scipy.
* Adjust the toml file as needed.
* move in to the new project created by poetry `cd project_name`.
* Add thrid party python libraries using `poetry add pandas`. This will initially create a virtual environment for you and if it is not the first time you run it, it will check that there are no dependancy issues.
* Check what libraries are installed using poetry not pip `poetry show`
* You can see the active virtual env `poetry env list` and get a full breakdown of it `poetry env info`. You may need the Path from the last command for configuring vscode.

# GIT
What is it: Awesome. Git is a tool for tracking changes in files (software). You can fork software, merge forks back to the main branch and push and pull files from are remote repository (github) to your local system.
* setup a two-factor authorisation or create a 'token' in github to give you the ability to push/pull between remote<>local through the github API: _Settings>Developer Settings>Personal Access Tokens_. I just save this token down in my LastPass password manager browser extension as a note and add it to my favourites so I can get at it quickly.
* There is truck loads you can do with git/github, but what I do typically is outlined in the WORKFLOW section below.

# VSCODE
What is it: VisualStudio Code is a software IDE that enables users to install bolt-on languages and extensions and themes as needed.  
How to install it:
* Many ways to install it, but running Linux Manjaro 21.X I could only get python to install in to it if I used the install from snapd.
* Snap is installed by default on a full install of Manjaro, but if you have installed the lite version then you will need to install it [install snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snap-on-manjaro-linux)
How to configure it:
* Must have extensions: Bookmarks, Bracket Pair Colorizer 2, GitLens, indent-rainbow, Material Icon Theme, Python (installs Jupyter and Pylance), Python Docstring Generator, vscode-icons. I also theme it with Dracula (as my entire system is themed this way).
* File>Preferences>Settings. Type _python formatting_ and make sure Black Path is correct as per `pipx list`. Also Black Args set with `--line-length\n79`. All changes are saved in to the vscode's settings.json file found `~/.config/Code/User/settings.json`. See below for mine (note: the defaultInterpreterPath changes):  
`{
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",  
    "python.formatting.blackArgs": [  
        "--line-length",  
        "79"  
    ],  
    "python.formatting.blackPath": "/home/duncan/.local/bin/black",  
    "python.defaultInterpreterPath": "/home/duncan/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/cross-profile-grapher-amgZGmvh-py3.9",  
    "workbench.iconTheme": "vscode-icons",  
    "terminal.integrated.automationShell.linux": "zsh",  
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "zsh",  
    "vsicons.dontShowNewVersionMessage": true,  
    "editor.formatOnSave": true  
}`  

# WORKFLOW
* create a new project in GitHub.com and select to add: _README.md_, _LICENCE_ (TheUnlicence) and the _.gitignore_ (Python).
* In terminal clone the git in to your working directory `git clone https://github.com/DuncanMcRae/test_project`. Note: you may have to provide a username and password/token.
* move in to the project folder `cd test_project`
* use pyenv to assign a local version of python to the folder `pyenv local 3.9.7`. This creates a hidden `.python-version` file.
* use poetry to create a new project `poetry new test_project`. Image shows the default new project along with the git files. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32591094/133867085-ff5dd487-33bd-4229-9bf5-42e84c7c39e5.png)
